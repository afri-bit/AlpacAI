# SDV.Link Mixed Reality Kit



## Introduction

The SDV.Link App is an app preloaded on our VR headsets available at BCX (Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro).

It is a controller-free application which visualizes and virtualizes a Virtual Car as well as a Mini map representing a Virtual City.

You're provided with an immersive environment with which you can develop car apps in lieu of an actual physical vehicle.

## What does it do and how does it work?

With SDV.Link, you are able to write applications based on Covesa and VSS signals. Applications emitting supported signals (listed below) can manipulate and visualize both the Virtual Car and how it works around the Virtual City. 

Interacting with the Virtual Car (e.g. opening doors, toggling switches, collisions to builidngs etc) also emits VSS signals so that your applications can react to these signals and write your use-cases.
